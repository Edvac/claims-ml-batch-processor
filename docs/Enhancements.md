# Future Enhancements for Claims ML Batch Processor

## Data Validation & Schema Management

**Current State**: Basic hardcoded column validation with minimal error handling
**Enhancement**: Implement comprehensive Pydantic-based schema validation

The current data processing pipeline relies on hardcoded column lists and basic existence checks, which can lead to silent failures when data schemas evolve. A Pydantic-based validation system would provide type safety, automatic schema drift detection, and clear error messages when data doesn't match expected formats. This enhancement would catch production issues early, provide self-documenting schemas, and enable graceful handling of schema changes without pipeline crashes.

**Key Benefits**:
- Prevents silent failures from missing or misnamed columns
- Provides immediate feedback on data quality issues
- Enables automated schema evolution tracking
- Reduces debugging time in production environments
- Serves as living documentation for data contracts

**Implementation Priority**: High - Critical for production reliability and data quality assurance.

## Config
Centralised config, through config loading utils and config files (yaml or json)

## Logging
Replace print statements inhereted from the Jupyter Notebook with logging

## Testing
Add unit testing and Integration tests

## Cloud Deployment

## ☁️ **Azure Functions Mapping (High Level)**

**Current local pipeline** easily maps to **Azure Functions** by:

1. **Packaging** the `claims/` module as a Function App deployment package with dependencies
2. **Storage Integration** replacing local file paths with Blob Storage triggers (`claims_*.csv` uploaded to container → Function triggered)
3. **Handler Conversion** converting `main.py` logic into a Function handler that processes blob objects and writes results back to output container
4. **Scheduling** via Timer triggers (`0 0 6 * * *`) instead of local cron
5. **Model Storage** using Blob Storage for model persistence or Azure ML Model Registry instead of local JSON files

The core ML logic remains identical - only the execution environment changes from local filesystem to serverless blob-driven processing.

### **Trade-offs:**
-  **Perfect for**: Azure-native environments, blob-heavy workflows, existing Azure infrastructure
- ️ **Limitations**: 10-minute execution limits (consumption plan), cold starts, vendor lock-in

## **Further Production-Grade Steps**

### **Azure ML + Databricks Platform**
- **Scale**: Databricks clusters for 10K+ daily claims processing
- **ML Lifecycle**: MLflow tracking, automated model versioning, A/B testing
- **CI/CD**: Azure DevOps pipelines, automated deployment, drift monitoring
- **Governance**: Role-based access, audit trails, compliance tracking
