# Future Enhancements for Claims ML Batch Processor

## Data Validation & Schema Management

**Current State**: Basic hardcoded column validation with minimal error handling
**Enhancement**: Implement comprehensive Pydantic-based schema validation

The current data processing pipeline relies on hardcoded column lists and basic existence checks, which can lead to silent failures when data schemas evolve. A Pydantic-based validation system would provide type safety, automatic schema drift detection, and clear error messages when data doesn't match expected formats. This enhancement would catch production issues early, provide self-documenting schemas, and enable graceful handling of schema changes without pipeline crashes.

**Key Benefits**:
- Prevents silent failures from missing or misnamed columns
- Provides immediate feedback on data quality issues
- Enables automated schema evolution tracking
- Reduces debugging time in production environments
- Serves as living documentation for data contracts

**Implementation Priority**: High - Critical for production reliability and data quality assurance.
